- A big problem with visualizing large graphs is visual clutter. 

We can reduce clutter by adjusting node positions and improving edge layout

- If edges are drawn using lines, we can squeeze these lines together according
  to hierarchy. In flat graphs, we can model edges as magnetically attracted to
  each other, to simultaneously emphasize strong connections between clusters
  and highlight unique connections. 

- the computational complexity of calculating this magnetism is O(N·M 2 ·K),
- where m is the number of edges, and k is the number of curves in the edge 
- these algorithms are not real time after 4000 edges

the algorithm is roughly 
  - for every edge in the graph, calculate the attraction and spring force
    applied by each other edge

  3 independent steps: calculate spring force,
  calculate electrostatic force, and update the positions of
  subdivision points

- A compatibility check is used to filter out the edges whose attraction would
  be too weak

- 4000 edges gpu outperforms cpu by 6x
- 15000 edges gpu outperforms cpu by 10x


- In this visualization, edges are drawn as cubic beziers, or curved lines.
- Thus each edge contains multiple points, a start, an end and the sub points in
  between

- these points are stored by column to maximize locality

- meaning that x and y coordinates of each point is stored in two different
  matrices

- Each row corresponds to a row in the matrix, and the coordinate of the point
  is the column

In GPU-FDEB, the graph
is represented as a matrix where all the points on each edge
are placed in each row (see Fig. 3), and the matrix is stored
in FORTRAN order in memory, i.e., all the 1st points of
each edge are stored in sequence, so are the 2nd points and
the 3rd points, etc. Furthermore, the coordinate X and Y of
all the points are separately stored in two matrixes.
