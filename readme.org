These are my notes summarizing a small part of the latest computer science
research papers.
* End to end learing in self driving cars
[[file:1604.07316.pdf][source]]
- CNN trained on data of front facing camera to human steering angle
- CNN have revolutionized pattern recognition
- CNN learn features automatically from training examples
- CNN are an old technique
  - The increased availablity of training data like ILSVRC
  - fast gpus
- two separate inputs for training and execution

* An Empirical Evaluation of Deep Learning on Highway Driving
[[file:1504.01716.pdf][source]]
- Use Camera, Lidar, Radar and GPS data to precompute lanes and bounding boxes
- Single gpu is used for single cnn
- future needs to create annotations in realtime

* Anatomy of a Scientific Rumour
aoeu
what could cause this?

* Parallelized Force Directed Edge Bundling on the GPU
